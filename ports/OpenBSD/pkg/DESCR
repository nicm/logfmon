The logfmon daemon monitors a set of syslog log files and matches each
new entry against the rules defined in its configuration file. Each rule
may be tested against entries from a single file, a set of files or from
all files. Depending on the rule, a command may be executed or the entry
may be ignored. All unmatched messages are batched together and mailed
every 15 minutes, or whatever alternative time is specified in the
configuration file.

Messages may also be collected into contexts and piped to a command
after a final message is found or a number of messages is reached.

I've currently tested on OpenBSD 3.6 and FreeBSD 4.10.

The Makefile requires BSD make.

To install, do:

	make

then, as root:
	
	make install

By default, the executable is put in /usr/local/sbin and the man pages in
/usr/local/man.

Create a logfmon.conf in /etc. My current logfmon.conf is included. Be careful
to escape characters that need it properly. This is my first attempt at
using lex/yacc so it may be a bit fragile, I'd appreciate feedback if so.

On OpenBSD, I add these lines to /etc/rc.local to run logfmon on startup:

	if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/logfmon -a -e /etc/logfmon.conf ]; then
        	echo -n ' logfmon';     /usr/local/sbin/logfmon
	fi

If you change the configuration, send a HUP to a running logfmon to make it
reload.

At the moment, the program assumes each log line has a 15 character date,
followed by a space, the hostname, another space and the message, for example:

Nov 16 11:46:34 hostname message

If this isn't the case, it almost certainly won't work properly.

Feedback is welcome.
